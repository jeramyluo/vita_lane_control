# Visual Task Specification for Lane Control
A highway self-driving model that uses Visual Task Specifications primarily seen in robotics and applies them to the output of a deep learning lane detection model to find steering and throttle inputs to keep the vehicle in the lane. The model was tested in a simulated setting in Grand Theft Auto V's highways.

More information on visual tasks specifications can be found in [this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Visual-Task-Specification-User-Interface-for-Visual-Gridseth/1bb3caff33a6771404434c5cf421c63fa382bcfa) by Gridseth et. al., or [this paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-Tasks-can-be-Performed-with-an-Uncalibrated-Hespanha-Dodds/2b4b27fa9992bb7d295a61e3ff0dd5d5baf945c5) by Hespanha et. al.
# Requirements
Install the required packages using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need the following programs/packages:

• [x360ce](https://www.x360ce.com/)

• [vJoy](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/)

• Grand Theft Auto V; optionally install [Simple Trainer for GTA V](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/simple-trainer-for-gtav) to control  weather, time, other vehicles and more to fine tune your testing setting.

# Instructions

1. Install required packages and programs
2. Download the TuSimple model from [here](https://github.com/PINTO0309/PINTO_model_zoo/tree/main/140_Ultra-Fast-Lane-Detection) and place the .onnx file into the models folder
3. Run x360ce, vJoy, and Grand Theft Auto V
4. Place character in a "Brute Camper" vehicle on the highway
5. Run lanecontrol.py
6. Change driving settings with the control panel
